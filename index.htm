<h1 style = "text-align : centre ; "> GLOBAL WARMING AND IT'S CAUSES </h1>
<hr>
<p1> What is the cause of Global Warming > The burning of fossil fuels, cutting down of trees etc. causes the temperature of the earth to increase. High temperature changes the weather patterns, causing the dry areas to get drier and wet areas to get wetter. Thus, increasing the frequency of disasters like floods, droughts etc.
The biggest problem facing our beloved world is global warming.<br>
The heat is becoming unbearable for most of the world’s 7.7 billion people<br>
We are the cause of this effect. We did this to ourselves, and we must fix this ourselves.<br>
Let’s stop saying that let’s do this and that. You who is speaking Also show what you have done so far.<br>
Many people have put forth a lot of effort but alone they can do nothing, Let’s work as if it’s the last chance<br>we have got; If we are not keen, we will not have a last chance.

<h2 style = "text-align : centre ; "> EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING </h2>
<hr>
<p1> Increased drought</p1>
<hr>
<p2>Water is becoming scarcer in more areas. Droughts can stir destructive sandstorms and dust storms that can move billions of tons of sand across continents. Deserts are expanding, reducing land for growing food. Many people now face the threat of not having enough water or food on a regular basis. We are ending ourselves.</p2>
<hr>


<p3>Loss of species<hr><br>Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in the ocean. These risks increase as temperatures climb. Forest fires, extreme weather and invasive pests and diseases are among many threats. Some species will be able to relocate and survive, but others will not.
We are destroying the diverse beauty of the Earth. </p3>
<hr>
<p4>Poverty and displacement<hr><br>Climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in poverty. Floods may sweep away urban slums, destroying homes and livelihoods. Heat can make it difficult to work in outdoor jobs. Weather-related disasters displace 23 million people a year, leaving many more vulnerable to poverty.</p4>
<hr>
<p5>Not enough food<hr><br>Changes in climate and increases in extreme weather events are among the reasons behind a global rise in hunger and poor nutrition. Fisheries crops, and livestock may be destroyed or become less productive. Heat stress can diminish water and grasslands for grazing.</p5>
<hr>
<p6>More health risks<hr><br>Changing weather patterns are expanding diseases such as malaria. Extreme weather events increase disease and death, and make it difficult for health care systems to keep up. Other risks to health include increased hunger and poor nutrition in places where people cannot grow or find sufficient food.</p6>
<hr>
<p7> A warming, rising ocean<hr><br>The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. This melts ice sheets and raises sea levels, threatening coastal and island communities. The ocean also absorbs carbon dioxide, keeping it from the atmosphere. More carbon dioxide makes the ocean more acidic, which endangers marine life.</p7>

<h3> HOW CAN WE SOLVE OUR PROBLEM.</h3>
<hr>
<p1>Save energy at home<hr><br>Much of our electricity and heat is powered by coal, oil and gas. Use less energy by lowering your heating and cooling, switching to LED light bulbs and energy-efficient electric appliances, washing your laundry with cold water or hanging things to dry instead of using a dryer.</p1>
<hr>
<p2>Walk, cycle or take public transport<hr><br>The world’s roads are clogged with vehicles, most of them burning diesel or petrol. Walking or riding a bike instead of driving will reduce greenhouse gas emissions – and help your health and fitness. For longer distances, consider taking a train or bus. And carpool whenever possible.</p2>
<hr>
<p3>Eat more vegetables<hr><br>Eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and less meat and dairy, can significantly lower your environmental impact. Producing plant-based foods generally results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and requires less energy, land and water.</p3>
<hr>
<p4>Reduce, reuse, repair & recycle<hr><br>Electronics, clothes and other items we buy cause carbon emissions at each point in production, from the extraction of raw materials to manufacturing and transporting goods to market. To protect our climate, buy fewer things, shop second-hand, repair what you can and recycle.</p4>
<hr>
<p5>Switch to an electric vehicle<hr><br>If you plan to buy a car, consider going electric, with more and cheaper models coming on the market. Even if they still run on electricity produced from fossil fuels, electric cars help reduce air pollution and cause significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions than petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.</p5>
<hr>
<p6>Consider your travel<hr><br>Aeroplanes burn large amounts of fossil fuels, producing significant greenhouse gas emissions. That makes taking fewer flights one of the fastest ways to reduce your environmental impact. When you can, meet virtually, take a train or skip that long-distance trip altogether
<hr>
<p7>Throw away less food<hr><br>When you throw food away, you're also wasting the resources and energy that were used to grow, produce, package and transport it. And when food rots in a landfill, it produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. So use what you buy and compost any leftovers.</p7>
